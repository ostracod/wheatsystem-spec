{timestamp}
        <p>WheatBytecode is the programming language provided by WheatSystem for applications. This document describes the syntax and instructions of WheatBytecode.</p>
        <p class="title2">DATA TYPES AND STRUCTURES</p>
        <p>All integers in WheatBytecode are stored in little-endian order. All signed integers use two's complement to express negative values.</p>
        <p>Integer data types are expressed in the following manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">u1</span> = Unsigned 1-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">u4</span> = Unsigned 4-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">u8</span> = Unsigned 8-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">s8</span> = Signed 8-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">u16</span> = Unsigned 16-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">s16</span> = Signed 16-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">u32</span> = Unsigned 32-bit integer</li>
            <li><span class="code">s32</span> = Signed 32-bit integer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each bytecode application file has the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Bytecode application file = [
    u32 global frame size,
    u32 function table length,
    u32 application data file position,
    Function table,
    Instruction array,
    Application data
]</pre>
        <p>Instruction bodies inside the instruction array must match the order of entries in the function table. Instruction bodies may not have unused space before or after their defined boundaries.</p>
        <p>Each function table entry in a bytecode application file has the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Function table entry = [
    s32 function ID,
    u8 is guarded,
    u32 argument frame size,
    u32 local frame size,
    u32 instruction body file position,
    u32 instruction body size
]</pre>
        <p>File types have the following enumeration values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">0</span> = Generic file</li>
            <li><span class="code">1</span> = Bytecode application file</li>
            <li><span class="code">2</span> = System application file</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each heap allocation stores the following bitfield of attributes:</p>
        <pre class="code">Allocation attributes = [
    u1 x6 unused bits,
    u1 is sentry,
    u1 is guarded
]</pre>
        <p>Gate modes have the following enumeration values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">0</span> = Stay open after `waitGate` instruction</li>
            <li><span class="code">1</span> = Close after `waitGate` instruction</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="title2">MEMORY LAYOUT</p>
        <p>A "frame" is used by an application to store variable data. The size of each frame remains fixed after it is allocated.</p>
        <p>Each frame has one of three types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The "global frame" is available at all times after the application launches.</li>
            <li>A "local frame" is available to the current function invocation.</li>
            <li>An "argument frame" is available to both the invoking function and invoked function.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each application has exactly one global frame. This frame is never removed.</p>
        <p>One or more threads may be active in the system at a time. Each thread contains a stack, which in turn contains local frames and argument frames. When a thread calls a function, a local frame is added to the stack. When a thread returns from a function, the corresponding local frame is removed from the stack.</p>
        <p>Argument values and return values are passed between functions through argument frames. If one function would like to call a function with arguments and read the return value, the calling function must perform these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Allocate an argument frame.</li>
            <li>Populate the argument frame with arguments.</li>
            <li>Call the function and wait for invocation to finish.</li>
            <li>Read return values from the argument frame.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the scenario described above, the invoked function would follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Read arguments from the argument frame provided by the calling function.</li>
            <li>Perform the desired set of operations.</li>
            <li>Store return values in the argument frame provided by the calling function.</li>
            <li>Return control to the calling function.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Every application has access to the unified system heap. Heap allocations have fixed size in the same manner as frames. If an application quits, the system will delete every heap allocation created by the application. Otherwise, applications must manually perform garbage collection.</p>
        <p>Applications may reference heap allocations by using pointers. Each pointer is a 32-bit integer generated by the system. The pointer value of the null pointer is zero.</p>
        <p>Every heap allocation may be marked as guarded or unguarded. The data in a guarded heap allocation may only be accessed by its creator or by applications with admin permission.</p>
        <p>A heap allocation may also be marked as a sentry. A sentry allocation is intended to be referenced by multiple applications. The sentry attribute serves as a mechanism to help applications enforce type safety. All file handles and gates are sentry allocations created by the system.</p>
        <p>Whenever a frame or a heap allocation is created, its contents are cleared so that every byte is zero. This ensures that one application cannot inspect memory which was freed by another application.</p>
        <p class="title2">INSTRUCTION SYNTAX</p>
        <p>Each bytecode instruction has the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Instruction = [
    u8 opcode,
    Array of arguments
]</pre>
        <p>Each argument is preceded by a prefix which has the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Argument prefix = [
    u4 reference type,
    u4 data type
]</pre>
        <p>Argument reference types have the following enumeration values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">0x0</span> = Constant</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x1</span> = Global frame</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x2</span> = Local frame</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x3</span> = Argument frame provided by calling function</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x4</span> = Argument frame which the next function invocation will receive</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x5</span> = Application data region</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x6</span> = Heap allocation</li>
            <li><span class="code">0x7</span> = Previous argument of same instruction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Argument data types have the following enumeration values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">0x0</span> = <span class="code">s8</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">0x1</span> = <span class="code">s16</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">0x2</span> = <span class="code">s32</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When reference type is <span class="code">0x0</span>, the argument will have the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Constant argument = [
    Argument prefix,
    Constant value
]</pre>
        <p>When reference type is <span class="code">0x1</span>, <span class="code">0x2</span>, <span class="code">0x3</span>, or <span class="code">0x4</span>, the argument will have the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Frame argument = [
    Argument prefix,
    Frame index as nested argument
]</pre>
        <p>When reference type is <span class="code">0x5</span>, the argument will have the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Application data argument = [
    Argument prefix,
    Application data index as nested argument
]</pre>
        <p>When reference type is <span class="code">0x6</span>, the argument will have the following structure:</p>
        <pre class="code">Heap allocation argument = [
    Argument prefix,
    Pointer as nested argument,
    Allocation index as nested argument
]</pre>
        <p>When reference type is <span class="code">0x7</span>, the argument will only consist of an argument prefix, and the data type in the prefix will be ignored.</p>
        <p class="title2">ERROR CODES</p>
        <p>Every error code must fit within a signed 8-bit integer. The sign of each error code holds special significance:</P>
        <ul>
            <li>An error code equal to zero represents the absence of any error.</li>
            <li>If an error code is positive, the error code is defined as part of the WheatSystem specification.</li>
            <li>If an error code is negative, the error code is defined as part of some third-party specification.</li>
        </ul>
